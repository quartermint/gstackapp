## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase dependency chain derived from requirements -- GitHub auth before pipeline, pipeline before comments, comments before dashboard, embeddings accumulate before cross-repo query layer, trends require historical data
- [Roadmap]: Signal quality (SGNL-01/02/03) grouped with Review Output (Phase 3) rather than standalone -- noise filtering is integral to PR comment quality, not a separate feature

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GitHub App registration required before Phase 1 execution (App ID, private key, webhook secret)
- Claude API key needed for Phase 2 pipeline execution
