## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2 decisions archived to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- (16-01) Hand-wrote migration SQL rather than using drizzle-kit generate, consistent with all prior migrations
- (16-01) Stars use githubId (integer) as PK matching GitHub's numeric repo ID
- (16-01) Discovery config uses .default({}) so existing mc.config.json parses without changes
- [Phase 17]: Underscore-prefixed _config param in promoteDiscovery for API contract stability with strict TS
- [Phase 17]: Single sh -c invocation for probeGitRepo to minimize process spawns during discovery scan
- (17-02) Timestamps serialized to ISO strings in route handler (Drizzle returns Date objects from timestamp mode)
- (17-02) Promote error (already tracked/dismissed) returns 400 VALIDATION_ERROR, not 409 Conflict
- (17-03) Discovery scanner tests use in-memory DB with query-level verification rather than filesystem mocking
- (17-03) Route tests verify timestamp serialization to ISO strings (catches Drizzle Date object issue)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 20 (Session Enrichment) convergence detection is novel. Validate algorithm against existing v1.2 session records before committing to UI representation.
