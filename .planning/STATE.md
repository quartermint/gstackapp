# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-30)

**Core value:** Every PR gets reviewed by five specialized AI brains -- each one catches what the others miss. The pipeline visualization makes the review process visible, not a black box.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-github-integration

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase dependency chain derived from requirements -- GitHub auth before pipeline, pipeline before comments, comments before dashboard, embeddings accumulate before cross-repo query layer, trends require historical data
- [Roadmap]: Signal quality (SGNL-01/02/03) grouped with Review Output (Phase 3) rather than standalone -- noise filtering is integral to PR comment quality, not a separate feature
- [Phase 01]: Zod 3.24 over Zod 4 for Phase 1 ecosystem compatibility with Hono/Drizzle/Anthropic SDK
- [Phase 01]: Explicit DatabaseType annotation on rawDb export for TypeScript composite project reference compatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GitHub App registration required before Phase 1 execution (App ID, private key, webhook secret)
- Claude API key needed for Phase 2 pipeline execution
